## Introduction
This thesis explores the implementation and performance of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, comparing them with traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). The aim is to understand the advantages and limitations of each approach in various scenarios.

## Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks are based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which states that any multivariate continuous function can be represented as a finite composition of continuous functions of one variable.

## Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)
MLPs are a class of feedforward artificial neural networks. They consist of multiple layers of nodes, with each layer fully connected to the next one. MLPs are widely used in various machine learning tasks due to their ability to model complex relationships.

## Comparison
The thesis compares Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and MLPs based on the following criteria:
- Computational efficiency
- Accuracy
- Model complexity
- Training time

## Results
The results of the comparison are presented in this section, showcasing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in different scenarios.

## Conclusion
The conclusion summarizes the findings of the thesis and provides insights into the practical applications of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and MLPs.
